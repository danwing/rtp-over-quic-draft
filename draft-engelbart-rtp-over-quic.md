# Introduction

TODO Introduction

# Terminology and Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Protocol Overview

This document introduces a mapping of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to the QUIC transport
protocol. QUIC supports two transport methods: reliable streams and unreliable datagrams
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, {{QUIC-DATAGRAM}}. RTP over QUIC uses the unreliable datagrams to transport
real-time data.

{{!RFC3550}} specifies that RTP sessions need to be transmitted on different transport addresses to
allow multiplexing between them. RTP over QUIC uses a different approach, in order to leverage the
advantages of QUIC connections without managing a separate QUIC connection per RTP session. QUIC
does not provide multiplexing between different flows on datagrams, but recommends the use of
variable-length integers to prepend each datagram with a unique flow identifier for multiplexing
flows. RTP over QUIC uses a flow identifier as a replacement for network address and port number, to
multiplex many RTP sessions over the same QUIC connection.

A congestion controller can be plugged in, to adapt the media bitrate to the available bandwidth.
This document does not mandate any congestion control algorithm, some examples include
Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) {{!RFC8698}} and Self- Clocked Rate Adaptation for
Multimedia (SCReAM) {{!RFC8298}}. These congestion control algorithms require some feedback about
the performance of the network in order to calculate target bitrates. Traditionally this feedback is
generated at the receiver and sent back to the sender via RTCP. Since QUIC also collects some
metrics about the networks performance, these metrics can be used to generate the required feedback
at the sender-side and provide it to the congestion controller, to avoid the additional overhead of
the RTCP stream.

> **TODO:** Should the congestion controller work independently from the congestion
> controller used in QUIC, because the QUIC connection can simultaneously be used for other data
> streams, that need to be congestion controlled, too?

# Local Interfaces

RTP over QUIC requires different components like QUIC implementations, congestion controllers and
media encoders to work together. The interfaces of these components have to fulfill certain
requirements which are described in this section.

## QUIC Interface

If the used QUIC implementation is not directly incorporated into the RTP over QUIC mapping
implementation, it has to fulfill the following interface requirements. The QUIC implementation MUST
support QUICs unreliable datagrams and it MUST provide a way to signal acknowledgements or losses of
datagrams to the application. Since datagram frames cannot be fragmented, the QUIC implementation
MUST provide a way to query the maximum datagram size, so that an application can create RTP packets
that always fit into a datagram.

Additionally, a QUIC implementation MUST expose the smoothed RTT as descirbed in {{Section 5 of
QUIC-RECOVERY}} to the application.

## Congestion Controller Interface {#cc-interface}

There are different congestion control algorithms proposed by RMCAT to implement application layer
congestion control for real-time communications. These algorithms keep track of the sent packets and
typically require a list of received packets together with the timestamps at which they were
received by a receiver to estimate the current bandwidth utilization and whether a media encoder can
be configured to produce output at a higher or lower rate.

> **TODO:** we require a CC algorithm to work with a list of received packets and their
> corresponding delays. These delays are probably estimated by using the QUIC RTT and the recorded
> sent-time. If the CC algorithms use these values only to calculate an RTT and delay-variation, we
> could instead just use the values which QUIC already records.

A congestion controller used for RTP over QUIC should be able to compute an adequate bandwidth
estimation using the following inputs:

* A list of packets that were acknowledged by the receiver
* For each acknowledged packet, a delay between the sent- and receive-times of the packet
* Optionally ECN marks

A congestion controller MUST expose a maximum bitrate to which an encoder can safely be configured
without overloading the network. Additionally a congestion controller may provide a pacing
mechanism.

## Codec Interface {#encoder-interface}

An application is expected to adapt the media bitrate to the observed available bandwidth by setting
the media encoder to the target bitrate that is computed by the congestion controller. Thus, the
media encoder needs to offer a way to update the target bitrate accordingly. An implementation can
either expose the most recent bitrate estimation produced by the congestion controller, or directly
take a callback to update the encoder bitrate which is called whenever the congestion controller
updates its target bitrate.

# Packet Format {#packet-format}


## Encoding: Binary representation

All packets are sent as datagrams with the following format:

~~~
Datagram Payload {
  Flow Identifier (i),
  RTP/RTCP Packet (..)
}
~~~
{: #fig-datagram-payload title="Datagram Payload Format"}

For multiplexing streams on the same QUIC connection, each RTP packet is prefixed with a flow
identifier. This flow identifier serves as a replacement for using different transport addresses per
stream. A flow identifier is a QUIC variable length integer which must be unique per stream.

## "How to transport / encapsulate"

# Protocol Operation

This section describes how senders and receivers can exchange RTP packets using QUIC. While the
receiver side is very simple, the sender side has to keep track of sent packets and corresponding
acknowledgement to implement congestion control.

RTP/RTCP packets that are submitted to an RTP over QUIC implementation are buffered in a queue. The
congestion controller defines the rate at which the next packet is dequeued and sent over the QUIC
connection. Before a packet is sent, it is prefixed with the flow identifier described in
{{packet-format}} and encapsulated in a QUIC datagram.

The implementation has to keep track of sent packets in order to build the feedback for a congestion
controller described in {{cc-interface}}. Each sent packet is mapped to the datagram in which it was
sent over QUIC and when the QUIC implementation signals an acknowledgement for a specific datagram,
the packet that was sent in this datagram is marked as received. Together with the received mark, an
estimation of the delay at which the packet was received by the peer is stored. This estimation can
be calculated from the RTT exposed by QUIC.

> **TODO:** RTT may be better replaced by an explicit timestamp

The list of received packets and delays can be passed to the congestion controller at a frequency
specified by the used algorithm.

The congestion controller regularly outputs a target bitrate, which is forwarded to the encoder
using the interface described in {{encoder-interface}}.

{: #fig-send-flow title="RTP over QUIC send flow"}

On receiving a datagram, a RTP over QUIC implementation strips off and parses the flow identifier to
identify the stream to which the received RTP packet belongs. The remaining content of the datagram
is then passed to the RTP session which was assigned the given flow identifier.

> **TODO:** Decide what to do whith unknown flow IDs and streams that do not belong to RTP
> over QUIC in the case where an application sends other data apart from RTP in datagrams over the
> same QUIC connection. Some options are:

> * If no RTP session with the flow identifier was registered, the packet is dropped.
> * An error can be signaled to the application.
> * The content can be forwarded to the application without being associated to a RTP stream. (This
>   would probably require a way to assign flow IDs more gerenally than per RTP stream)
