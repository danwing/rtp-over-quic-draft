# Terminology and Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Protocol Overview

This document introduces a mapping of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to the QUIC transport
protocol. QUIC supports two transport methods: reliable streams and unreliable datagrams
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, {{QUIC-DATAGRAM}}. RTP over QUIC uses the unreliable datagrams to transport
real-time data.

{{!RFC3550}} specifies that RTP sessions need to be transmitted on different transport addresses to
allow multiplexing between them. RTP over QUIC uses a different approach, in order to leverage the
advantages of QUIC connections without managing a separate QUIC connection per RTP session. QUIC
does not provide multiplexing between different flows on datagrams, but recommends the use of
variable-length integers to prepend each datagram with a unique flow identifier for multiplexing
flows. RTP over QUIC uses a flow identifier as a replacement for network address and port number, to
multiplex many RTP sessions over the same QUIC connection.

A congestion controller can be plugged in, to adapt the media bitrate to the available bandwidth.
This document does not mandate any congestion control algorithm, some examples include
Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) {{!RFC8698}} and Self- Clocked Rate Adaptation for
Multimedia (SCReAM) {{!RFC8298}}. These congestion control algorithms require some feedback about
the performance of the network in order to calculate target bitrates. Traditionally this feedback is
generated at the receiver and sent back to the sender via RTCP. Since QUIC also collects some
metrics about the networks performance, these metrics can be used to generate the required feedback
at the sender-side and provide it to the congestion controller, to avoid the additional overhead of
the RTCP stream.

> **TODO:** Should the congestion controller work independently from the congestion
> controller used in QUIC, because the QUIC connection can simultaneously be used for other data
> streams, that need to be congestion controlled, too?
